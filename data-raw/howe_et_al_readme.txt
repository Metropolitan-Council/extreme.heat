Project summary, description or abstract: This dataset contains model estimates of how Americans perceive the health risks of extreme heat events at the state, county, and census tract level in the U.S. Estimates are produced using a statistical model based on national survey data. These data are associated with the following publication:

Howe, Peter D., Jennifer R. Marlon, Xinran Wang, and Anthony Leiserowitz. ÒPublic perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across U.S. states, counties, and neighborhoods.Ó 2019. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1813145116 
8. Brief description of collection and processing of data: Risk perception estimates are produced using a multilevel regression and post stratification (MRP) model based on national survey data (n = 9,217) collected in summer 2015. Estimates are based on a heat risk perception index that ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating higher risk perceptions. People with higher risk perceptions were 1) more likely to think that a heat wave would occur in their community; 2) more likely to think that a heat wave, were it to happen in their community, would affect the health of themselves, their family, and others in their community; and 3) more worried about the effects of heat waves. See associated publications for details. 9. Description of files (names, or if too numerous, number of files, file type(s):a. "riskp_state_nt_table.csv" contains estimates of the heat risk perception index for the adult population (18+) at the U.S. state level for 2015.
b. "riskp_county_nt_table.csv" contains estimates of the heat risk perception index for the adult population (18+) at the county level for 2015. 
c. "riskp_state_nt_table.csv" contains estimates of the heat risk perception index for the adult population (18+) at the census tract level for 2015. 10.
